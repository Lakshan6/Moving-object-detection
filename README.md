# Moving-object-detection
This project helps in detecting a moving object in front of the camera using artificial intelligence library called opencv.

Hi I made this project during the 30days AI course with pantech solutions

.

The instructor during the session was Sanjay.




I got to have hands on experience on:

Artificial intelligence about opencv



Issue if you have more than one camera attached to your system:

If you have more than one camera connected to your system,
then try changing the code "cam = cv2.VideoCapture(2)". 
Just try the change the value 2 to 1 or 3 based 
on number of cameras attached to your system.




Thank you.
